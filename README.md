## I'm Lucas and welcome to my profile :)

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving my coding skills studying web dev with the help of ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com), an open-source community-made web development course, and [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/), a course tackling modern web development.
