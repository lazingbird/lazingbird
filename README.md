## My name's Lucas and welcome to my profile :)

🔭 I’m currently working on improving my coding skills studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript with help of ["The Odin Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com), an open-source community-made web development course, and some ["Origamid"](https://www.origamid.com/) courses.
